# Adventures-of-Sammy
This is a game I made as a final project to a class. It was supposed to be a "group" project but my group members never helped with the coding and they didn't contribute much to the assets either, therefore we ran out of time, hence the ugly code and an unfinished game. I created the sprites using this handy sprite creator I found online: 
 <a href="http://gaurav.munjal.us/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/#">Universal LPC Spritesheet Character Generator.</a> I created the "Begin Adventure" button in photoshop. To this day, I have no idea how I did it, but I actually really like it. I also used the Zelda theme song. Game Over screen was created in MS Paint - Don't hate :) 

The purpose of this project was to create a game depicting the effects of moral and immoral decisions such as the classic Trolley dilemma/problem. Every decision the player made, moral or immoral, had consequences in the form of a guilt and energy meter. We went with typical good guy vs bad guy scenario(sorta). TBoth the good and bad guys had guilt meter that would be affected based on the player choices. If the good guy's guilt meter went to high, then game over. If the bad guy's guilt meter went too low, then game over. 
The player's choices also get saved to a file, so they could see the decisions they took. 

To create this "we" used Eclipse IDE and the <a href="http://slick.ninjacave.com/">Slick2D Java Game Library</a>, which itself is based off the LWJGL OpenGL bindings. The Javadoc and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDBQfCd08&list=PL210C2267A8922854">TheNewBoston, Java Game Development with Slick playlist</a> are your best friends here.

Aside from the headaches and all nighters, making this was actually pretty fun. I think the finished version would've came out decent but at this point, starting from scratch would be easier. 

To execute, just run the Game java file.
